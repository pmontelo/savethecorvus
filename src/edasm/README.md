# EDASM for ProDOS Source Code
All 6502 source code is designed for the EDASM for ProDOS Editor Assembler.
[CiderPress II](https://ciderpress2.com/) is a useful tool for moving source code between a Mac or PC for editing with a full screen editor.

For lightning quick compiles, I suggest assembling the code on an Apple II Emulator like [Virtual II](https://www.virtualii.com/) or [AppleWin](https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin) with the emulator set to run at full speed.

Attempting to compile in another assembler is likely to lead to frustration and non-working object code.
